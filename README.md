# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview

In this project, we used Javascript's Leaflet and D3 libraries, Mapbox API, and geoJSON data from the US Geological Survey to create interactive maps. These maps show earthquakes that have recently taken place all over the world and the tectonic fault lines that exist on the different continents. These maps can be filtered to show all earthquakes, major earthquakes, and the fault lines. Additionally, the maps can be changed to visualize the data on three different map styles.
